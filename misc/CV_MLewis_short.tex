%%%%% Research interests
%\section*{Research Interests}

%How does a word come to stand for a meaning? My research explores this question at two levels of analysis: the individual speaker acquiring language and the socially-emergent lexicon. These two levels of analysis take place over different timescales---the lifespan of a speaker and the course of language evolution, respectively. But, they are necessarily deeply related to each other because the lexicon that emerges from a social group is the product of individual speakers acquiring and transmitting a language. I use experimental and computational methods to explore this and related questions.
